# VISUALIZATION ABOUT THE CAUSE OF DEATH AROUND THE WORLD

The goal of our project is to compile a comprehensive and interactive data visualization of the information regarding the specific mortality count in each nation, the list of causes of death pertaining to the related nation as well as each causeâ€™s associated confirmed deaths. With this data, we hope to be able to easily identify the leading causes for the loss of life and find out the potential flaws, setbacks as well as potential negligences within the healthcare system to handle such causes, from not only across the world, but also concerning specific nations, in order to improve on our health quality as well as our daily lifestyle. Moreover, this data would prove to be helpful to our individual selves as well, in recognizing and exercising caution against the most probable causes of deaths described in the visual.
